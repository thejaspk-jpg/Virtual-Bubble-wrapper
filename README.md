### Project Description
Your virtual bubble wrap project is a fun, interactive game where users can immerse themselves in the simple joy of bubble-popping. Players start by choosing the number of bubbles they want to pop, adding a bit of strategy to the experience. Once they set their goal, a countdown timer begins, giving them a fixed amount of time to pop as many bubbles as they can within that limit. Every pop adds to their score, which is dynamically updated, allowing users to see their progress in real time.

The sound and feel of each pop mimic the satisfaction of real bubble wrap, making it an oddly relaxing yet competitive experience. The game‚Äôs concept is refreshingly simple, but the time constraint keeps players engaged, challenging them to beat their own scores or set new records each time they play.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Your virtual bubble wrap game solves the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of our weird obsession with popping bubble wrap! It‚Äôs a fun way to relieve boredom and stress, giving people an easy, satisfying break. With a timer and score, it adds a playful challenge, making it a quick, entertaining escape from everyday routines.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution is an interactive, virtual bubble wrap experience designed to recreate the satisfying feel of popping real bubbles. Users select how many bubbles they want to pop, and as they click to pop each one, they earn points. The challenge lies in racing against a set timer, making the experience fun, engaging, and slightly competitive.

This digital version solves the need for a quick, satisfying break without real bubble wrap, making it easily accessible anytime, anywhere. It‚Äôs perfect for taking a mental breather, adding a playful pause to daily routines, and giving people a way to unwind in a lighthearted way. The game‚Äôs scoring system and timer make it appealing for users to keep coming back, either to improve their score or simply to enjoy the stress-relieving joy of bubble-popping.
